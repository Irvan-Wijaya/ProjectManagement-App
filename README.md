# Project & Task Management App 

Basic project management web application that can add project name, project description, due date, and tasks.

## What I have learned in this dummy project

- Hooks (useState, useRef, useImperativeHandle)

- Conditional Rendering 

- Custom Component (Input, Modal, Button)

- Styling (Tailwid CSS)

- Rendering Lists (.map, .filter)

- State Management (Lifting State Up, Props)

- Others (createPortal, forwardRef)
